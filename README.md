# Data-Augmentation-for-High-Dimensional-Covariance-Estimation-Master-s-Thesis-
The thesis presents a novel data augmentation framework that integrates regression-based imputation, cross-validation, and transfer learning to reconstruct incomplete return histories and address the challenges of high-dimensional covariance estimation.

Applied to S&P 500 portfolios, the framework consistently improves out-of-sample volatility and drawdown performance. It demonstrates robustness across shrinkage, factor-based, and classical estimators. Designed to be scalable and estimator-agnostic, the methodology supports a wide range of financial applications including portfolio construction, risk forecasting, stress testing, and factor modeling, especially in settings with limited or unstable historical data.
